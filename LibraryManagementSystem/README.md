# BEL Library Management System - Classic ASP (.asp) & MySQL

A complete, feature-rich **Classic ASP (`.asp`)** web application for library management built with **VBScript**, **ADODB**, and **MySQL (SQLyog)**. 

The system features **3-Role Access Control (RBAC)**, custom **Book Requests with Start & End Dates**, dynamic dashboards, and full catalog management.

--- 

## 🌟 Key Features

* **3-Role Access Control (RBAC)**:
  * 🔴 **Admin**: Full control over system overview metrics, books (add/edit/delete), member book request approvals, authors, and categories.
  * 🟣 **Librarian**: Operational management of system overview metrics, books (add/edit), member book request approvals, issue/return transactions, authors, and categories.
  * 🟢 **Member**: Personal dashboard, book catalog search, custom book requesting, and personal borrowing history tracking.
* **Book Request & Approval Pipeline**:
  * Members select books and submit requests specifying custom **Start Date** (Borrow Date) and **End Date** (Due Date).
  * Staff (Admin/Librarian) review pending requests on `requests.asp` to **Approve** or **Reject** them.
  * Approving a request automatically creates an active borrowing transaction and updates available book copies.
* **Dual-View Dashboards**:
  * Staff sees system-wide counters (Total Books, Pending Requests, Active Borrowings, Total Members).
  * Members see personal metrics (Active Borrowings, Pending Requests, Available Books).

## 🚀 Setup & Installation Guide

### Step 1: Database Setup in SQLyog / MySQL
1. Open **SQLyog** (or MySQL Workbench / Command Line) and connect to your MySQL Server instance (`localhost:3306`).
2. Open `schema_mysql.sql` and execute all statements.
3. This creates the `LibraryDb` database and seeds users, authors, categories, and books.

### Step 2: Configure IIS Server
1. Press `Win + R`, type `optionalfeatures`, and press **Enter**.
2. Under **Internet Information Services ➔ World Wide Web Services ➔ Application Development Features**, enable **ASP** (Classic ASP).
3. Ensure **MySQL ODBC Driver** (e.g. `MySQL ODBC 26.7 Unicode Driver` or `MySQL ODBC 8.0 Driver`) is installed.
4. Open **IIS Manager** (`inetmgr`):
   * Create a Virtual Directory / Application pointing to `C:\Projects\library\LibraryManagementSystem`.
   * Open **ASP** settings in IIS Manager and set **Enable Parent Paths** to `True`.

### Step 3: Access the Application
Open browser and navigate to:
👉 **`http://localhost/LibraryManagementSystem/login.asp`**

## 🌐 Accessing from Other PCs on Local Wi-Fi / LAN (Zero Setup!)

If the app is running on your PC, other devices on the same Wi-Fi network can access it without installing anything:

1. Open Command Prompt on your PC, type `ipconfig`, and find your **IPv4 Address** (e.g. `192.168.1.15`).
2. On any other PC, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone connected to the same Wi-Fi, open the browser and navigate to:
   ```text
   http://192.168.1.15/LibraryManagementSystem/login.asp
   ```
